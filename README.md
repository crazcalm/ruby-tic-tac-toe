#Tic Tac Toe Crazcalm
---
##What is this?
	This is a simple tic tac toe clone that allows for both
    one player and two player play.


##Project Goal
	This project was my personal attempt at re-learning Ruby
    while trying to gain a basic understanding of how to use
    Glade and GTK+ to build GUIs.
    
    With that said, I have no plans of continuing this project.
    
    I used VisualRuby to build this project. Without their
    tool, I would have never attempted this project.
